testrail-client
===============

.Net Standard 2.0 implementation of the TestRail API.

### Getting Started

```C#
var client = new TestRailClient("https://[your-organization].testrail.io", username, password);
var project = client.GetProjects().First();
var runs = client.GetRuns(project.ID);
var suite = client.GetSuites(project.ID).First();
var cases = client.GetCases(project.ID, suite.ID);
for (var case in cases) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Test Case {case.ID}: {case.Title}");
}
```

### To Modify

Solution was built using Visual Studio 2017 (make sure you have the latest version).

## To Release a New Version
- pull latest
- update the [TestRail.csproj](TestRail/TestRail.csproj) file with the new `Version` and `Release Notes`
- commit and push changes
- pull new code (just for sanity)
- restore nuget dependencies: `.nuget\nuget.exe restore`
- rebuild the project using MS Build with the following command: `msbuild /t:pack /p:Configuration=Release`
  - Make sure that you have msbuild in your path
  - The new .nupkg file will be in the `TestRail\bin\Release\` directory.
- `NuGet push TestRail.<version>.nupkg`

## Unit Testing
- Update the `appsettings.json` with the correct values for the TestRail instance you want to hit.
- Run the unit tests from VS Test Explorer or by running `dotnet test TestRail.Tests\TestRail.Tests.csproj` from the root directory.
